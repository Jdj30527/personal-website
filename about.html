                    <h1>Hi there</h1>
                    I've always been interested in how computers work and what they can do. Even when I was young I loved the idea of what could be created from one. I've always wanted to be the one who created these wonderful things.<br><br>
                    Before I decided to pursue computer science, I wanted to be a music producer. I loved all things creative: music, theatre, art. I spent most of my younger years performing in my school's theatre department. I was always thinking about the future and what kind of creative adventures I would go on. After realizing I didn't have the musical touch, I went to my second passion, computers. I figured out my passion was for designing and creating. I wanted to create beautiful visuals that people would love to look at and use.<br><br>
                    I grew up in a small town in central Virginia, but I never wanted to live my life there. I dreamed of heading out and seeing the world and I hope to make that a reality. You can usually find me out on a walk somewhere or relaxing by a pond listening to music. <br><br> I'm still learning new things about myself every day.<br><br> x<br> John
